E-Commerce Data Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce data to enhance the understanding of customer behavior and improve online shopping experiences. By utilizing RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation, K-means clustering, and data visualization techniques, the project aims to offer actionable insights for optimizing customer engagement, retention, and revenue.
   
## Introduction

E-commerce has significantly transformed modern business practices. This project explores e-commerce data to understand market trends, buying patterns, and customer behavior. Our primary objectives include ensuring data integrity, improving cybersecurity, and enhancing the online shopping experience through effective data analysis and visualization.

## Summary of Results

- **RFM Analysis:** Examined customer behavior based on recency, frequency, and monetary value of transactions.
- **K-means Clustering:** Segmented customers into distinct clusters to tailor marketing strategies.
- **Data Visualization:** Utilized various plots and graphs to illustrate key findings, such as customer loyalty trends, purchase frequency, and revenue distribution.

## Data Sources

The data for this analysis was sourced from Kaggle:

## Results and Methods

### Elbow Method

The Elbow Method was used to determine the optimal number of clusters for K-means clustering by analyzing the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS).

### Data Visualizations

- **Recency Distribution Plot:** Shows the distribution of recent transactions.
- **Frequency Distribution Plot:** Illustrates how transaction frequencies are distributed.
- **Monetary Distribution Plot:** Depicts customer spending patterns.
- **Recency vs. Frequency Plot:** Analyzes the relationship between recency and transaction frequency.
- **Frequency vs. Monetary Plot:** Examines the correlation between transaction frequency and monetary value.
- **Recency vs. Monetary Distribution Plot:** Provides insights into the correlation between recency and monetary value.

### Customer Insights

- **Histogram:** Displays the distribution of orders per customer.
- **Top 10 Most Frequently Purchased Products:** Highlights the products with the highest sales.
- **Top 10 Product Categories by Revenue:** Shows the revenue generated by different product categories.
- **Top 5 Countries by Number of Orders:** Identifies the countries with the highest order volume.
- **Country vs. Average Order Value:** Reveals correlations between countries and average order value.
